In this project, i am aiming to give "support" to one of my classification of given two or more plant species using their sepal and petal dimensions. This is a simple code of how the species is correctly gonna identifies if we give the dimensions. Before this refer what is a Support Vector Machine algorithm in machine learning. In layman words, it is an algorithms that comes under supervised learning, which the programmer classifies certain objects by giving data points. For examle, to differentiate apple and lemon, the datapoints are "Clour= red", Shape="round" ect. In SCM, we can use quantifyable data points to classify the objects. SVM can adjust to learn by relation ships between two entire different objects. The data set and code, seems to usefull has been uplpaded in this repository. Thank you.
